FAsm-fas
========
This program is intended to be used with the PureBasic compiler and
allows the creation of flat assembler's symbolic information files.

It is a thin wrapper around the `FAsm.exe` file contained within the
`PureBasic\Compilers` directory. The original `FAsm.exe` needs to be
renamed to `FAsm2.exe` in order for `fasm-fas.exe` to replace `FAsm.exe`.
